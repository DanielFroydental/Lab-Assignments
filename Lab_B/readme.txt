Lab B: Dynamic Data Structures and Binary File Manipulation
This lab involves creating a virus detection program using linked lists and binary file manipulation in C.
The program reads virus signatures from a file, stores them in a linked list, scans a suspected file for viruses,
and can automatically neutralize detected threats.

How to Use
1. Compile: Run make to build AntiVirus.c.
2. Run: Execute with ./AntiVirus <suspected_file>.
3. Menu Options:
    0) Set signatures file name
    1) Load signatures
    2) Print signatures
    3) Detect viruses
    4) Fix file
    5) Quit
