This lab explores memory management, pointers, and simulating object-oriented behavior in C.
The focus is on implementing a menu-driven program (menu_map.c) that uses function pointers and structures.

How to Use
1. Compile: Run make to compile the menu_map.c program.
2. Run: Execute the compiled program with ./menuMap to interact with the menu and explore various pointer-related functions.
